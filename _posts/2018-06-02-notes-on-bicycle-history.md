- EVs can reach something like 150 MPGE. bicycles are about 1000 MPGE, and if you’re really good, all the way up to 9000 MPGE. incredibly efficient

<center>1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagon</center>

- earliest cars looked like carriages without horses. and a lot also looked like bicycles, like above.
- The Standard Bicycle
  - it was more like a unicycle lol
  - game-changing because first many parts of the 1700s, bicycles had no pedals. It was more like an artificial horse that people would push off with their feet
- 1880s was the introduction of the safety bicycle (our modern take on a bike)
  - innovated on having two equal wheels, and to have it function, it needed the chain (sprocket) to function

- these two were massively successful product launches
- Safety Bicycle had just gone through a tremendous boom and dozens of international companies were manufacturing bikes
  - Arms manufacturers in New England began converting their manufacturing systems to create bikes
  - “Western Method” (Chicago School of Manufacturing) changed from Armory Practice of milling and forging approach (from weapons) to sheet metal stamping for many of the bike’s parts
  - This allowed for Chicago to really compete against the east coast companies
- eventually changed women’s freedom. women could start wearing different clothing for pedaling, and Susan B Anthony even said it was a foundational cause for the suffrage movement
- distance between two spouses went from 1 mile to 10 miles when bike boomed
  - even decreased rates of incest, too
- Pope Manufacturing Company in Boston began putting two cylinders and some gasoline to create the motorcycle (the chain drive architecture of motorcycles) derived directly from the bicycle
  - Adding the first wheels were not far imagination after that…
  - the motorcycle really wasn’t designed to replace horses. the correct logic is that adding a motor to a bicycle was completely logical when moving upmarket as the market matures
- in 1903, two bicycle mechanics created the first airplane (famously)
- France between 1900-1910 was the hotbed for automobile innovations (not Germany not USA)
  - engine in front, steering wheel, transmission, rear drive, front wheel steering
  - Model T was a replication of the technologies of Europe, just improved on manufacturing process
- Austin 7 popularized the pedal setup of modern cars and most UI of driving as it was exported worldwide, originated in Cadillac
  - to the contrary, the Model T UI was terribly bad and Austin 7 was monumental in molding that
- Manufacturing company and design of cars and airplanes all stemmed from the bicycles
  - it was the people relevant in the bicycle industry with their manufacturing capability of bicycles and know-how of designing kinetic vehicles that brought on next generation of technologies (Bicycle Mafia lol)
- The people who introduced the car were from the mode of thinking of bicycles (literal definition of disruption). they built the auto and aviation industry without significantly being of it
  - they had no business being in the long-distance transportation industry
  - Rolls Royce would sell the chassis with motor, then you would commission a coach-builder (formerly coach builders with horses) to put a body on it that suited your taste
  - coach-makers (horses) partners with carmakers
    - the mechanics and engine design (like Rolls Royce) came from a totally different genetic line off there transportation industry
    - they were not the coach-builders, railroad companies, or shipping companies
- Armory Practice - interchangeability of parts developed in 1860-1880 with bicycle industry (called Armory Practice, arms makers in civil war needed to manufacture at large scale and with standardization and really required the reproducibility and interchangeability of parts, transferred to bicycle manufacturers. really a pivoting point in manufacturing b/c of this)
  - to contrast, the European Method of manufacturing (crafts-based method) was building all up at once - like the marvel and craftsmanship of a whole suit of armor in Europe
  - the American Method of manufacturing require little skill at all - canonically, Ford could hire anyone off the street to build his cars
    - didn’t need to be apprenticed, trained up, went to special school for metalworking/woodworking like European Method of manufacturing required
    - trade laws in Europe were largely influential in slowing down Europe’s manufacturing capabilities because of barricades to manufacture individually
  - for one, the US was such a miracle post-war because of the production system, then Japan ran off with it and built an empire (arguably)
- Modern Transportation/Ideas Surrounding:
  - Utility-Theory Travel Demand Model<sup>[2]</sup>
    - when people start commuting 90 minutes or more, they decide to move into the city, cities start to contract
    - giving people more transport option helps cities spread out. a person who lives 5 minutes from work may decide to move out to 20 minutes away with more transportation
  - Faster transportation DOES NOT imply shorter commute times
    - Marchetti’s Constant - since Neolithic periods, people have had a constant travel time budget (about one hour)
    - So, as transportation gets faster, it’s conceivable to believe that transportation times will not get shorter; rather, people will move farther away, expanding cities.<sup>[3]</sup>
