- Wired data transfer happens through coaxial cables
  - This is the metaphorical highway for internet, telephone, and television cabling
  - These three core services share the bandwidth within coaxial cables
  - 3 core services = ‚ÄúTriple Play‚Äù. Triple Play becoming obsolete. More like 1.5 Play, Internet + Streaming
- Distribution of both ‚Äútelevision‚Äù and telephone consumption shifting toward streaming and cell, respectively
  - Conservative numbers pin tradition television consumption to drop from 86% to 60% in 10 years
  - [2016] ‚Äú50.8% of households had only mobile service, up from 48.3% a year earlier. Another 39.4% of households had both types of service and 6.5% had landlines only. The survey found 3.2% of homes had no phone connection of any kind.‚Äù <sup>[1]</sup>
  - Renters and young adults are likely to only have a cell phone. Unit economics in favor of phone cord-cutting, cell phones instead. VoIP still more expensive than complete cord-cutting. Large telecom wants to cut cords as well and investing in Internet infrastructure. Revenue for legacy voice systems dropped 11% in 2016. <sup>[2,3,4]</sup>
- Effects:
  - 1: ISPs can increase bandwidth solely for Internet applications, including streaming
    - If you have half a pie remaining, you can eat it üòõ
    - Applications like GeForce NOW are compelling side effects
    - Foreseeable that ISPs increase Internet prices to offset lost revenue from degradation of Triple Play.
    - Important question: Does unit demand for Internet bandwidth exceed bandwidth capability of current infrastructure? If not, this option is useless. See point 2.
  - 2: Does unit demand for Internet bandwidth exceed bandwidth capability of current infrastructure? If not, this could spell interesting opportunity for other uses of network/cable infrastructure already in place.
    - Underutilized asset. How can it reach maximum efficiency once again? Company that does this right can capture so much value‚Ä¶
