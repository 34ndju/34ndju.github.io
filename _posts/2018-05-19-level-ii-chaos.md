There are two classes of chaos: level one and two (aka Soros’ Theory of Reflexivity<sup>[1]</sup> with its objective and subjective realities). The former characterizes systems by a lack of response to prediction and the latter by response to prediction. The oft-cited examples of these are weather (a predictive model can become infinitesimally accurate because the system doesn’t change based off weather reports) and financial markets (predictive models simply cannot be infinitesimally accurate because they affect the system) There are lots of great resources to understand these two classes better<sup>[2][3]</sup>, and I find the Oscars example<sup>[3]</sup> very compelling.

To better understand level two chaos (subjective reality), I’ve gathered a few examples in this world. This is nothing more than a mental exercise:

- Venture Investing in Hot Technologies
  - VCs will rush in troves to hot technologies in expectation of massive returns. This only dilutes the returns with flooded capital, making returns sub-proportional (to expectations) for investors of that specific technology. *This does not imply unsuccessful returns*
- Traffic Navigation Applications
  - Waze + Google Maps use live traffic data to reroute drivers to the most optimal, least trafficked route. As drivers enter said route with least delay, traffic builds up, and this route is again categorized as sub-optimal.<sup>[4]</sup>
- Antibiotics
  - We formulate a new antibiotic, but bacteria mutation survival in response to the antibiotic renders the antibiotic useless over time.
- Warnings of Misbehaving Sentient AI
  - People who claim to be oracles of the singularity<sup>[5][6]</sup> only bring attention to the field, and on the coattails of attention arrives money for R&D spend to accelerate the subjects of their warnings.
- Live Music Performance
  - Anticipation of a great experience at live music vs. streaming at home draws a large crowd, which detracts from the live experience if standing far away from performer. This is especially true at music festivals.

[4] This is where I believe there’s an opportunity for traffic coordination applications. Waze + Google Maps have critical mass, and informing drivers of level two chaos and offering traffic coordination on top of routing will lock users into the application.
