- Avoid the Obvious Content
  - When beginning to write, think of all the first arguments that come to mind and compile them into a list. Then when you’re actually writing, avoid all of these topics.
    - Forces you to think of and write down contrarian ideas
- Take the Less Usual Side
  - Take the side (there may be 3+ sides) that seems hardest, least defensible
  - “Don't worry too much about figuring out what the instructor thinks about the subject so that you can cuddle up with him”
  - e.g. when tasked with writing about dogs, argue that they possess “a vacuity of mind and an inconstancy of purpose; that the dogs you have known most intimately have been mangy, ill-tempered brutes, incapable of instruction”
- Slip Out of Abstraction
  - Speaking in generalities dulls the reader’s mind
  - AVOID “football is bad for the colleges,” “it has become too commercial,” “football is big business,” “it is bad for the players,” etc.
  - Like great writers, write from the generality, the abstract statement, to the concrete example, the facts and figures, the illustrations.
    - e.g. REPLACE “Sororities teach girls the social graces.” WITH “Sorority life teaches a girl how to carry on a conversation while pouring tea, without sloshing the tea into the saucer.”
- Get Rid of Obvious Padding
  - Chopping down sentences is derived by replacing empty sentences with that of the above
- Call a Fool a Fool
  - e.g. “In my opinion, the principal of my high school acted in ways that I believe every unbiased person would have to call foolish.” → “My high school principal was a fool.”
  - Avoid “in my opinion,” “it seems to me,” “as I see it,” etc.
- Beware of Pat Expressions
  - Avoid “to all practical intents and purposes,” “the pure and simple truth,” “from where I sit,” “the time of his life,” “to the ends of the earth,” etc.
  - These are simply fillers
- Colorful Words
  - Simple: More descriptive words that bring more color are favorable most of the time
  - Don’t drown the reader in it though
- Colored Words
  - aka connotations
  - Every utterance of a word carries all previous utterances with it
- Colorless Words
  - Beware of words like circumstances, cases, instances, aspects, factors, relationships, attitudes, eventualities. They are many times just padding with little value.
