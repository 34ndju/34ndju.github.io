- Technology = three factors
  - as a means to fulfill a human purpose
  - as an assemblage of practices and purposes
  - as the entire collection of devices and engineering practices available to a culture
- Point three above is the most vital in “innovation”
  - New parts are added or subtracted over iterations
  - Dispels the idea of the inventive genius, masterfully crafting technologies out of nothing
- On the flip side, there are phenomena that are independent of humanity and technology
  - Once these phenomena are better understood, humanity can harness them to create technologies
- First iterations on new technologies are quite crude but soon converge on something of huge utility. Eventually, however, the marginal gains are outweighed by cost of achieving them, which makes a paradigm shift necessary (aka phenomena)
- 4 mechanisms of innovation:
  - novel solutions develop out of small standard engineering advances
  - radical novel technologies develop through the process of innovation
  - novel technologies develop by change in their internal parts or by addition to those parts through structural deepening
  - the wholesale emergence of new technologies that build and creatively transform industries over time (paradigm shift)
- This mechanism of addition, deletion, and paradigm shift makes innovation everlasting<sup>[1]</sup>
- Infrastructure and technology development have a simultaneous and complementary relationship (prevalent in transportation infrastructure)
  - when two are merged together, they enable a technological quantum leap with significant economic effect
    - the combination of iron wagonway<sup>[3]</sup> (railroad infrastructure) and steam engine (a prime mover - converts natural energy to mechanical energy)
  - when they occur in isolation, the effects are diminished (infrastructure and technology base)
    - Monorail railway using sails definitely did not take off<sup>[2]</sup>
