  	  <ul>
  <li>Avoid the Obvious Content
    <ul>
      <li>When beginning to write, think of all the first arguments that come to mind and compile them into a list. Then when you’re actually writing, avoid all of these topics.
        <ul>
          <li>Forces you to think of and write down contrarian ideas</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Take the Less Usual Side
    <ul>
      <li>Take the side (there may be 3+ sides) that seems hardest, least defensible</li>
      <li>“Don’t worry too much about figuring out what the instructor thinks about the subject so that you can cuddle up with him”</li>
      <li>e.g. when tasked with writing about dogs, argue that they possess “a vacuity of mind and an inconstancy of purpose; that the dogs you have known most intimately have been mangy, ill-tempered brutes, incapable of instruction”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Slip Out of Abstraction
    <ul>
      <li>Speaking in generalities dulls the reader’s mind</li>
      <li>AVOID “football is bad for the colleges,” “it has become too commercial,” “football is big business,” “it is bad for the players,” etc.</li>
      <li>Like great writers, write from the generality, the abstract statement, to the concrete example, the facts and figures, the illustrations.
        <ul>
          <li>e.g. REPLACE “Sororities teach girls the social graces.” WITH “Sorority life teaches a girl how to carry on a conversation while pouring tea, without sloshing the tea into the saucer.”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Get Rid of Obvious Padding
    <ul>
      <li>Chopping down sentences is derived by replacing empty sentences with that of the above</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Call a Fool a Fool
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. “In my opinion, the principal of my high school acted in ways that I believe every unbiased person would have to call foolish.” → “My high school principal was a fool.”</li>
      <li>Avoid “in my opinion,” “it seems to me,” “as I see it,” etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Beware of Pat Expressions
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid “to all practical intents and purposes,” “the pure and simple truth,” “from where I sit,” “the time of his life,” “to the ends of the earth,” etc.</li>
      <li>These are simply fillers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Colorful Words
    <ul>
      <li>Simple: More descriptive words that bring more color are favorable most of the time</li>
      <li>Don’t drown the reader in it though</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Colored Words
    <ul>
      <li>aka connotations</li>
      <li>Every utterance of a word carries all previous utterances with it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Colorless Words
    <ul>
      <li>Beware of words like circumstances, cases, instances, aspects, factors, relationships, attitudes, eventualities. They are many times just padding with little value.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
