  	  <ul>
  <li>What distinguishes a Dasein from other beings?
    <ul>
      <li>Takes its own being as an issue and questions it.</li>
      <li>Constantly engages in activities that it cares about.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Constantly engaged:
    <ul>
      <li>The world isn’t simply something to be known</li>
      <li>What a being cares about. The three pillars of care structure:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facticity">Facticity</a>
            <ul>
              <li>Many of the things beings care about are not explicitly chosen, yet they dictate what they care about</li>
              <li>Dasein in 10,000 BC will not care about social media. Dasein in 2018 will not care about hunting buffaloes (likely)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Fallenness
            <ul>
              <li>Beings fall into tasks by default, mostly from others around us telling us what we should be doing
                <ul>
                  <li>Jokingly: Follow fashion, go to school, get a job. Now say, “I am free”</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>This is not inherently bad. Simply, this is what makes a dasein. It’s part of nature.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Existentiality
            <ul>
              <li>Daseins have possibilities</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Once you realize these three care structures and how they affect your being, you’re left with a choice.
        <ul>
          <li>You’re on a spectrum of authenticity and inauthenticity</li>
          <li>Inauthentics only embody the first two parts of this care structure
            <ul>
              <li>Never consider the possibilities at their disposal</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Authentics radically consider the possibilities they have
            <ul>
              <li>“Dasein’s own potentiality”</li>
              <li>Be introspective and question the cultural and historical context that you’ve been born in</li>
              <li>“Being one’s own. Living for yourself”</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>This is not an ethical doctrine. One is not better than the other
            <ul>
              <li>(under breath) though leaving 1/3 out seems bad</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When you start living authentically, you start seeing the symptoms of the sickness of modern Daseins
    <ul>
      <li>Small talk, for example. Idle chatter rather than actual speech</li>
      <li>Scientific inquiry is curiosity, not understanding</li>
      <li>Our daily lives as calculators:
        <ul>
          <li>“Man finds himself in a perilous position…A far greater danger threatens [than the outbreak of a third world war]: the approaching tide of technological revolution in the atomic age could so captivate, bewitch, dazzle and beguile man that calculative thinking may someday come to be accepted and practiced as the only way of thinking. What great danger then might move upon us? Then there might go hand in hand with the greatest ingenuity in calculative planning and inventing, indifference towards ‘meditative’ thinking, total thoughtlessness. And then? Then man would have denied and thrown away his own special nature – that he is a meditative being. Therefore the issue is keeping meditative thinking alive.”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Technology = revealing.
        <ul>
          <li>Studying ancient languages allow us to understand “being”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>So how do we view other people?
    <ul>
      <li>What happens when we become the <a href="https://highexistence.com/friedrich-nietzsches-guide-to-conquering-your-existence/">Nietzsche child</a>? And become alienated?
        <ul>
          <li>Then it becomes time to go back to realize that being a Dasein is to be one of a facticity (history and culture). Embrace facticity, and then enhance life with this new view.</li>
          <li>Allegedly, this is why Heidegger became a Nazi</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why is it OK to talk about inevitability of hunger, but not inevitability of death?
    <ul>
      <li>Truly facing the reality of death makes us into true individuals: who I am.
        <ul>
          <li>You’re not your role (teacher, husband, engineer)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>When in a lecture, in 1961, Heidegger was asked how we might recover authenticity, he replied tersely that we should simply aim to spend more time ‘in graveyards’.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
