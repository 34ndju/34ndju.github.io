  <li>Early Immigrant influx heavily influenced the networks of today and general ethnic makeup
    <ul>
      <li>Vinod Khosla cites ethnic networks as natural</li>
      <li>Modern examples like Rubrik</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>First computers came out of need for larger counting: Adding machine invented by William Burrough (1885) and tabulator for census by Hermann Hollerith (1890)</li>
  <li>~1905: West Coast needed to distribute power and entrepreneurs understood Sierra Nevada dams could provide power
    <ul>
      <li>EE + high-tension voltage was born out of this need unique to the West Coast</li>
      <li>Stanford EE department</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cyril Elwell founded Poulsen Wireless Company (renamed to FTC) out of university by commercializing arc transmitter for radio transmission invented by Danish Valdemar Poulsen. Blew away the competition of East Coast and won Navy contract, the largest customer by far
    <ul>
      <li>First large-scale commercialization of radio technologies and long distance signal</li>
      <li>FTC hired Lee DeForest, inventor of audion, to amplify the signals because they would be lost on lost routes. This drastically reduced the cost of radios and made it scalable.</li>
      <li>Began a nationwide radio network through this, and it began with first tower in SF in 1910</li>
      <li>Early mainstream application was broadcasting of Presidential election of 1916<br />

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<center>1916 Election, with Woodrow Wilson emerging victorious</center>

<ul>
  <li>Long history, even since 1900s, of engineers being business leaders on the West Coast</li>
  <li>Bay Area became center of amateur radio technologies because of its maritime proximity</li>
  <li>During WWI, radio technology proved to be invaluable for defense, and the government distrusted the west coast from wielding such great power
    <ul>
      <li>Government helped form GE (and its subsidiary RCA) which came to dominate consumer radio applications, and FTC was doomed to serve only the military</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In 1910s, computing started to come to light in commercial areas like Detroit and NYC, boost coming from bureau
    <ul>
      <li>Hollerith‚Äôs Tabulating Machine Company (TMC) acquired by new company in NYC, and it changed its name to IBM</li>
      <li>Main tabulating (and computation) customers were insurance and railroad companies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Automating the Office (1920s):
    <ul>
      <li>Typewriters dominated by Remington</li>
      <li>Adders dominated by Burroughs</li>
      <li>Tabulators dominated by IBM</li>
      <li>Cash registers dominated by NCR (National Cash Register lol)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>FTC was the earliest instance of a ‚Äúmafia‚Äù on the west coast (1926-1934)
    <ul>
      <li>(Ralph Heintz) Heintz and Kauffman: Installing short-wave radios on ship and airplanes, directly competing with RCA</li>
      <li>(Charlie Litton) Litton Engineering Laboratories: Manufactured tools for vacuum tube manufacturers</li>
      <li>(Bill Eitel, Jack McCullough) Eimac: Vacuum tubes for amateur (ham) radio market. Military‚Äôs favorite during WWII</li>
      <li>(Gerhard Fisher) Fisher Research Laboratories: Invented metal detector</li>
      <li>Many of these entrepreneurs started out as ham/amateur radio fanatics starting at an early age</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Atomic and nuclear research at Berkeley drew lots of top talent and even the first Nobel Prize to the Bay Area, unified largely by the Lawrence Berkeley Lab (1930s)</li>
  <li>Navy was pivotal in developing the area as a consumer of radio technology
    <ul>
      <li>Opened up a base between Palo Alto and San Jose called Moffett Field in 1933</li>
      <li>Followed by Ames Research Center</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1939, HP founded
    <ul>
      <li>Walt Disney was first customer as they purchased HP‚Äôs product, the oscillator, for ‚ÄúFantasia‚Äù<br />
<img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_AEC952BF3F1C7C81E51F0C5A59ED3D2CDC997A4ED4CE31640EC9029A55D8DBEE_1525238704427_Integrierter_Quarzoszillator_smial.jpg" alt="Oscillator" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;/center&gt;Oscillator&lt;/center&gt;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stanford professor Willism Hansen and two students formed a company around an amplifier for generating EM waves  at higher frequencies than radio
    <ul>
      <li>Improved radar technologies, vital for WWII pilots</li>
      <li>As a common theme, Industry+University ‚Üí Advanced technologies sold to military</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Elsewhere:
    <ul>
      <li>Alan Turing presents abstract idea of a Turing machine (1937)</li>
      <li>John Von Neumann created simple architectural idea for computer storing both instructions and memory, spread from Princeton due to its open research policy</li>
      <li>Bell Labs formed in NYC (1925)
        <ul>
          <li>Proposal by George Stibitz to create binary relay-based arithmetic machine, an it was commercialized and named as ‚ÄúModel K‚Äù<br />
<img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_AEC952BF3F1C7C81E51F0C5A59ED3D2CDC997A4ED4CE31640EC9029A55D8DBEE_1525239232302_MonroeKA-574-IMG_0672-5.jpg" alt="Model K" /></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<center>Model K</center>

<ul>
  <li>Konrad Zuse in Germany created first hardware implementation of universal Turing machine called the ‚ÄúZ3‚Äù (1941)</li>
  <li>HP Case Study
    <ul>
      <li>Began as contractors building miscellaneous electrical projects like lane signaling for bowling alley</li>
      <li>1943: Produced electrical lab testing equipment, $1M revenue, most from Navy (WWII)</li>
      <li>Management by Walking Around (MBWA): Instead of waiting for subordinates to report, management would walk around and actively engage people
        <ul>
          <li>Open door policy - sort of like open office today</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Harmony between founders: Ask a founder one question, you‚Äôll get same answer from other founder -John Granger</li>
      <li>Packard presented rules to deal with people in 1958 Sonoma Retreat (repeated in On Leadership)
        <ul>
          <li>Think about the other person first</li>
          <li>Built up the other person‚Äôs sense of importance and don‚Äôt forget to respect the other person‚Äôs ‚Äúpersonality rights‚Äù (the right to be different)‚Ä¶empathize</li>
          <li>Give sincere appreciation. Don‚Äôt openly try to reform people</li>
          <li>Eliminate the negative. Focus on solutions and not on what can‚Äôt be done</li>
          <li>Examine your first impressions on people, products, and companies</li>
          <li>Take care of details (tone of voice, smiling, greeting, appearance)</li>
          <li>Develop genuine interest in people</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Firing was always the last resort</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Many technologies used by US during the war (and later commercialized) were imported, like a follower nation in 1940
    <ul>
      <li>Tape recorder, commercialized as a subsequent product to Ampex‚Äôs airborne radar antennas, was manufactured after a soldier took it from Germany. It was invented by Fritz Pfleumer.</li>
      <li>First computer created in Britain called the Colossus Mark  1 created in 1943. Harvard Mark 1 followed in 1944. This was the first computer programmed by punched paper tape.
        <ul>
          <li>couldn‚Äôt store programs, so women had to feed punched programs into the machine sequentially.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After WWII industrial production rose by over 50% in a span of 10 years</li>
</ul>
